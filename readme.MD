# HFH Inventory

## Summary

This is a demo of a very basic inventory system for my local Habitat affiliate built on Django. 

## Prerequisites

Built on top of Django 2.0, using Django Rest Framework. Requires Python 3.6. 

## Import Data

The import_inventory management command was built around a very specific CSV data set that I already had. In the unlikely event that someone 
decides to use this, they'll likely need to modify that command code for their own purpose.
